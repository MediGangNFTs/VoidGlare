# Void Glare ðŸ‘ï¸

Void Glare is a lightweight animated project featuring a mysterious floating eye that follows user input with subtle curiosity, blinks randomly, and adds eerie atmosphere for games or interactive experiences.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Blinking effect and slow eye-tracking
- Works on mobile and desktop (touch + mouse support)
- Minimal and optimized for embedding (e.g., Carrd.co or static hosting)
- Simple setup with HTML/CSS/JS only

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. File Structure
Place all files in your project root:

```
index.html
style.css
script.js
README.md
```

### 2. Run Locally
You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve via any static file host like:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push to a GitHub repo
2. Import the repo into Vercel
3. Set the root to `/` (if prompted)
4. Deploy ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ’¡ Customization
You can tune the look and behavior by editing `style.css` and `script.js`:

- Adjust eye size, glow color, blink speed, etc.
- Modify the floating behavior in `script.js`

## âš ï¸ Notes for Carrd Users
Embed only the necessary `<script>`, `<style>`, and HTML `<div>` into the **Body Bottom** section. Avoid heavy animations for best results.
